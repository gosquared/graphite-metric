If you're sending data to Graphite from Ruby, GraphiteMetric will help you get
it in the right format. For now, it only supports the plaintext protocol, but
pickle should be relatively easy to add. Contributions are welcome.

At [GoSquared](http://www.gosquared.com/), we're using graphite extensively.
Some services use it directly via TCP, others via UDP (direct or via
aggregators such as statsd). When metrics are critical, we push them into our
RabbitMQ cluster. Carbon agents support AMQP natively, thus an efficient and
fault-tolerant setup is achievable with little effort.

## USAGE

What is a `GraphiteMetric::Plaintext`?

    GraphiteMetric::Plaintext.ancestors
    => [GraphiteMetric::Plaintext,
     Struct,
     Enumerable,
     Object,
     Kernel,
     BasicObject]

### From values

    graphite_metric = GraphiteMetric::Plaintext.new("visitors", 2)
    => #<struct GraphiteMetric::Plaintext
     key="visitors",
     value=2,
     timestamp=1331043095>

    graphite_metric.key
    => "visitors"
    graphite_metric.value
    => 2
    graphite_metric.timestamp
    => 1331043095

    graphite_metric.to_s
    => "visitors 2 1331043095"

    "#{graphite_metric}"
    => "visitors 2 1331043095"

`GraphiteMetric::Plaintext` is the same as `GMP`. The following examples will
use the abbreviated form.

### From hash

    gmp = GMP.from_hash(
      :key       => "visitors",
      :value     => 2,
      :timestamp => Time.now.to_i
    )
    => #<struct GraphiteMetric::Plaintext
     key="visitors",
     value=2,
     timestamp=1331039853>

    "#{gmp}"
    => "visitors 2 1331039853"

### From array (of hashes)

    gmps = GMP.from_array([
      {
        :key       => "visitors",
        :value     => 1,
        :timestamp => Time.now.to_i
      },
      {
        :key   => "visitors",
        :value => 5
      }
    ]
    => [#<struct GraphiteMetric::Plaintext
      key="visitors",
      value=1,
      timestamp=1331039914>,
     #<struct GraphiteMetric::Plaintext
      key="visitors",
      value=5,
      timestamp=1331043514>]

    gmps.map(&:to_s)
    ["visitors 1 1331039914", "visitors 5 1331043514"]
